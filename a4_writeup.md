# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

Since I missed some days, I think trying to understand where we were and what the code meant was difficult. Some of the code under class TTTBoard: was understandable and some were hard to follow.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

You can add a computer to the game by writing code to respond to the user input and the numbers already on the board.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

The code written would have the computer loop through possible choices that could result in filling the board and picking the best outcome.
